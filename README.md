# WaxKey
 WaxKey is a python program I made because I didn't want to pay for Dashlane, WaxKey provides the following functions:
 - Random password generation of any length and excluding any characters desired
 - Saving passwords to a local .txt file with the associated website name
 - Search currently saved passwords using site name and copy to clipboard
